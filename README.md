## Keras_deployment_to_AWS
### Problem statement:
Illustrate Keras deployment on AWS Sagemaker.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Solution is categorised into two phases.
* Training phase
* Deployment phase
### 1. Training phase.
 One of the great features of Sagemaker is that it is modularized so that the process of training a model is decoupled from deploying the model. Also, one can enter to and exit from any of it's stages! Partly to demonstrate that feature and partly to harness free GPU facility in Google colab, I am building a CNN model on colab and deploying it on Sagemaker platform.
